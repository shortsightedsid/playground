= Playground Scheme =

This is not really Tiny Scheme. Its just my import of the SVN repo at https://tinyscheme.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/tinyscheme via Github's svn import. 
I'm planning to use this repo to try things and play with the code. Its really for me to learn scheme.

= TODO =

# Clean up the indentation of the C code. That will help me understand the code better
# More experiments as I understand Scheme better.
